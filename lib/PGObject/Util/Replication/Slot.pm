=head1 NAME

PGObject::Util::Replication::Slot - Manage and Monitor Replication Slots

=head1 VERSION

Version v0.01.01

=cut

our $VERSION = 'v0.01.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides a low-level interface for monitoring and managing
replication slots.  It is intended to be used by other management modules
and therefore requires read and write operations to pass in a database handle.

Slots here represent values and should be treated as read-only once
instantiated.  This is to improve utility when it comes to monitoring and
logging.


    use PGObject::Util::Replication::Slot;

    my @slots = PGObject::Util::Replication::Slot->all($dbh);
    my $slot = PGObject::Util::Replication::Slot->get($dbh, 'slotname');

    # can also create and delete
    my $slot = PGObject::Util::Replication::Slot->create($dbh, 'slotname');
    my $success = PGObject::Util::Replication::Slot->delete($dbh, 'slotname');
    

=head1 SLOT PROPERTIES

Properties are set from the database.  Tthey are not intended to be set
by develoers.

=head2 slot_name

Name of slot. 

=head2 slot_type

logical or physical

=head2 active

boolean

=head2 restart_lsn

Last log serial number sent

=head2 full_data

A json object of the whole pg_replication_slots entry.  You can use this to 
get data not supported by base versions, such as last confirmed wal flush 
on Postgres 9.6.  Note that the format here varies from version to version.

=head2 query_time

The return value of the now() command at the time the query was run.

=head2 pg_current_xlog_location

The current transaction log/wal lsn for the current system.  We will not
change this field here even when running on PostgreSQL 10

=head2 current_lag_bytes

The byte offset between the current xlog logation and the last restart lsn
for the slot.  This means basically the number of bytes that have not yet
been confirmed as read by the slot compared to our current WAL.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 all($dbh, [$prefix])

Returns a list of objects fo this type filtered on the prefix specified/

=head2 get($dbh, $name)

Gets the slot specified by name

=head2 create($dbh, $name, [$type])

Creates a new slot, by default a physical one, with the specified name.

=head2 delete($dbh, $name)

Deletes the slot with the given name.  Note that this will allow wal segments 
that are pending to be archived and thus may prevent the replica from being
able to gatch up through normal means.
