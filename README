PGObject-Util-Replication-Slot

This module provides general management functions of replication slots
to the frameworks which use them.  The actual database connection handling
is not within the responsibiity of this module.  I.e. this module acts as a 
task runner to fetch information on database replication slots of the
specified database handle.

This module is intended to be called from other modules which are more
closely tied to database handles and therefore tha annoyance of passing
the db handle in to the function is expected to be minimal.
